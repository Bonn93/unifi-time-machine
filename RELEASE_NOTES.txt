## 🚨 Migration Required - latest/older development tags
We have moved from running as `root` to running as `appuser` with UID/GID `1000:1000` for improved security and compatibility.
**Action Required:** Please run `chown -R 1000:1000 ./data` on your host machine before starting this container or destory and fully recreate.
If not you will see issues like `2025/12/15 16:57:58 Error enqueuing job for timelapse 24_hour: failed to insert job: attempt to write a readonly database`.


## 📦 version v0.0.2
* Improved CPU performance for timelapse generation
* Added support for the HQ Snapshot query on the UniFi Protect API. A new setting defaults to `auto` will check the camera capabilities and use the HQ snapshot if available.
